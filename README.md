# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple command-line game of rock-paper-scissors written in Python.

## How to Play

1. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
2. The game will prompt you to enter your choice: rock, paper or scissors.
3. The computer will then randomly choose its own move and the result of the game will be displayed.

## Code Explanation

The code uses the `random` module to generate the computer's move. The `play()` function takes in user input and compares it with the computer's move to determine the result of the game. The `is_win()` function checks if the player's move beats the opponent's move according to the rules of rock-paper-scissors.

Have fun playing!
